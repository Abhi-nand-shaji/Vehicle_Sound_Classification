# Vehicle_Sound_Classification
This project focuses on classifying roadside vehicle-related sounds—such as car horns, ambulance sirens, engine noises, and traffic noise—using deep learning techniques. The primary objective is to enable intelligent transportation systems (ITS) and smart cities to recognize emergency vehicles or traffic patterns using sound.

The pipeline extracts meaningful features from audio using Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) and trains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to perform multi-class classification.
