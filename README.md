# Vehicle_Sound_Classification
Roadside Vehicle Sound Classification Using Deep Learning
Project Overview
This project focuses on the classification of roadside vehicle-related sounds—including car horns, ambulance sirens, engine noises, and general traffic sounds—using deep learning techniques. The goal is to support Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) and smart city infrastructures by enabling the real-time recognition of traffic patterns and emergency vehicles through acoustic analysis.

*Objective*
To develop a robust and scalable sound classification system that can:
Identify and differentiate between multiple vehicle-related sounds
Assist smart traffic management systems in prioritizing emergency responses
Enhance situational awareness for hearing impared people in autonomous and connected vehicle environments

*Methodology*
Audio Preprocessing:
Raw audio signals are processed and converted into spectrograms using Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs), which effectively capture the time-frequency characteristics of vehicle sounds.

*Model Architecture:*
A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is trained on the MFCC features to perform multi-class classification across different types of vehicle-related sounds.

*Classification Targets:*
Engine Noise
Ambulance Siren
FIre Engine Siren
General Traffic Noise (which includes sound of horns)

*Applications*
Emergency Vehicle Detection: Automatically identify the presence of sirens to adjust traffic signals.
Urban Sound Monitoring: Improve traffic flow and safety in smart cities through real-time acoustic monitoring.
Assistive Systems: Potential integration with driver assistance systems, especially for hearing-impaired individuals.

*Tools and Framework*
Python
Librosa (for audio feature extraction)
TensorFlow/Keras (for CNN training)
NumPy, Matplotlib (for preprocessing and visualization)
