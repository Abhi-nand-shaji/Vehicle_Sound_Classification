# Vehicle_Sound_Classification
 Roadside Vehicle Sound Classification Using Deep Learning
Project Overview
This project focuses on the classification of roadside vehicle-related sounds—including car horns, ambulance sirens, engine noises, and general traffic sounds—using deep learning techniques. The goal is to support Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) and smart city infrastructures by enabling the real-time recognition of traffic patterns and emergency vehicles through acoustic analysis.

# Objective
To develop a robust and scalable sound classification system that can:

Identify and differentiate between multiple vehicle-related sounds

Assist smart traffic management systems in prioritizing emergency responses

Enhance situational awareness in autonomous and connected vehicle environments

# Methodology
Audio Preprocessing:
Raw audio signals are processed and converted into spectrograms using Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs), which effectively capture the time-frequency characteristics of vehicle sounds.

# Model Architecture:
A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and an LSTM are trained on the MFCC features to perform multi-class classification across different types of vehicle-related sounds.

# Classification Targets:

Car Horn

Ambulance Siren

Engine Noise

General Traffic Noise

# Applications
Emergency Vehicle Detection: Automatically identify the presence of sirens to adjust traffic signals.

Urban Sound Monitoring: Improve traffic flow and safety in smart cities through real-time acoustic monitoring.

Assistive Systems: Potential integration with driver assistance systems, especially for hearing-impaired individuals.

# Tools and Frameworks
Python

Librosa (for audio feature extraction)

TensorFlow/Keras (for CNN training)

NumPy, Matplotlib (for preprocessing and visualization)
